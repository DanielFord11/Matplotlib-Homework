1) the average tumor volume directly cooresponds to the weight of the mouse 
2) since the weight has such an impact on the tumor volume, it would make more sense to quantify effectives of the drugs by measuring the percent increases/decreases of tumor volume from start to finish 
3) Though Capolin and Ramicane had the lowest final tumor volumes, you can't say they're the best unless you juxtapose them with the avg weights of the mice. It could be that they just have lighter mice on average and thus lower starting/final tumor volume
